I think this would be a much more difficult task if the order/positioning of elements were not predictable. The exercise was easier with the geometric textures than with the icons. I think this was because I was able to keep the shape constant within the geometric version, approximating the use of a sequential colour scheme. With the icons, varying the same parameters produced wildly different results depending on the icon and I was trying to interpret the shapes at the same time as the textures.

 I left my least favorite vegetable ""celery"" completely empty. As this is completely different than the rest (despite it follows the same scale - but not linear - the extreme at the worst), this highlights how much I dislike celery compared to others.

 One might think it makes more sense to make my favorite vegetables more visibly prominent (coloring them in black and with detailed textures).

 -- there are already visually crowded (playing with empty spaces can be more useful.
