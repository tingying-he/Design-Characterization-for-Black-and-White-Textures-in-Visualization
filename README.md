# Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization

## Content
- texture-design-interface folder: source code to implement texture design interface. We used this interface in our Experiment 1.

- experiments-codes folder: source code to implement Experiments 1 and 3. For experiment 2, we used the LimeSurvey platform; therefore, there is no source code.

- experiments-stimuli-results-analysis folder: stimuli, results, and data analysis scripts for Experiments 1, 2, and 3.
