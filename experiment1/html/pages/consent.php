                        Project name: Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are invited to take part in this project of which the purpose is to explore how to use texture in visual data representations. The Aviz team is an expert in the field of visualization and the results of these experiments will help us to improve visualization design and research in this field more generally. This study will take place online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The expected benefits of the project are the following: Low-color visualization is a concise, accurate, and powerful way of visualizing data that has broad application potential. Black-and-white representations can lead to more accessible visualizations and avoid unwanted color association. In addition, visualizations with very few colors can be used in new environments such as knitting, embroidery, or 3D printing. Texture is an effective channel to replace color in  low-color visualization. However, texture has a lot of parameters and there is currently a lack of research on how to combine these parameters to make texture suitable for visualization. Our project will help us understand how we can best display information and data aesthetically and effectively with texture, and help push the development of low-color visualization further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project has received a favorable opinion from Inria's Operational Committee for the Assessment of legal and ethical risks.

                    <h4>YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT</h4>

                    <h5>Conditions of your participation:</h5>

                    <h6>Participation Requirements</h6>
                    <p>
                        Participants must be fluent English speakers, of legal age (18 years in most countries), and consider himself/herself experienced on the topic of visualization and in design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to participate, we will save some experiment parameters in the local storage in your browser.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Procedure</h6>
                    <p>
                        We first ask  participants for their informed consent and background information. After being walked through a tutorial and getting familiar with our design tool, participants will design two charts each, using one of two texture types with our design tool. Then we will ask participants about their design strategies, their opinion on using these two types of textures. We will also apply the texture they design for the assigned chart type to another two chart types and ask for their opinions about how their design transfers to other chart types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole experiment will take around 25 minutes. After the participants finish the experiment, we allow participants to do more trials if they wish. If they decide to do more, the duration time will add approximately 15 minutes for each additional trial.
                        We will not take photographs or videos.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>
                        This research will contribute to research in low-color visualization design.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Risks and drawbacks</h6>
                    <p>
                        There are no known risks or drawbacks associated with this research study.
                    </p>
