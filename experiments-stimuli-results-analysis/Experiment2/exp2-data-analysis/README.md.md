This folder includes the data and analysis scripts for Experiment 2. We have encrypted the original prolific IDs of participants, converting them to new unique IDs.

## Contents of this folder

1. The `final_data` folder contains all the original data.
2. The `CI-analysis` folder contains pre-processed data and scripts for generating CI (Confidence Interval) graphs.

## How to use the scripts?

1. Run `exp2_data_analysis.ipynb` to obtain basic information about this experiment, such as demographic information, and prepare data for CI analysis.
2. In the `CI-analysis` folder, run R scripts to generate the CI graphs for Experiment 2.
